colony: USCAnt // first line specifies the ant's name
 
// This program controls a single ant and causes it to move
// around the field and do things.
// This ant moves around randomly, picks up food if it
// happens to stumble upon it, eats when it gets hungry,
// and will drop food on its anthill if it happens to 
// stumble back on its anthill while holding food.
 
// here's the ant's programming instructions, written
// in our 'Bugs' language
